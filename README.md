Credit score classification with Machine Learning using python

Credit score classification refers to the grouping of credit scores into distinct classes based on the numerical value of the credit score. Credit scores are numerical expressions that represent the creditworthiness of an individual, ranging from good, standard and poor. These scores help lenders assess the risk of lending money to individuals.
I will take you through the process of credit score classification with Machine learning using Python. 
You can download the datasets used here https://statso.io/credit-score-classification-case-study/
We will use Python's pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and plotly for visualization.

We will follow 7 steps to achieve our goal

STEP 1: Import the necessary libraries.

STEP 2: Load and inspect the data
The datasets used here are https://statso.io/credit-score-classification-case-study/

STEP 3: Visualize the credit score distribution
Here we visualize the credit score based on different aspects like occupation, monthly inhand salary, annual income etc etc

STEP 4: Change categories to numbers
To use categorical data (like 'Credit_Mix') in our machine learning model, we need to convert these categories into numbers.

Step 5: Define Independent Variables and dependent variables
We'll define the independent variables - features and the dependent variable - target by selecting the features we found important for our model.

STEP 6: Train a random forest classifier
We'll use a Random Forest Classifier to classify the credit scores.

Step 7: Predict credit score
Finally, we predict the credit score based on the user's input as per the features we used to train the model.

In conclusion, we explored how to classify credit scores using a dataset. We used pandas to manipulate the data, plotly to visualize it, and scikit-learn to build a Random Forest Classifier. Understanding how to classify credit scores can provide valuable insights for financial decision-making and risk assessment. 
A person with a good credit score will get loans from any bank and financial institution.
